    docker-compose up
    ```

5. Visit your site on: [http://example.com.test:8080](http://example.com.test:8080)

### Enable SSL 

If you need ssl for local development this can be enabled using mkcert with the following command: 

```
$ scripts/enable_ssl.sh
```

Please note that this installs a trusted development certificate on your local machine whcih gives complete power 
to intercept secure requests from your machine. Do not share it!


### Remote debugging for xdebug

If you want remote-debugging for xdebug you need to make sure some ENV-vars is available 
when docker-compose build.
You could either add them to your local environment (e.g. .zshrc) or add a .env-file in the 
project root.
```
XDEBUG_REMOTE_HOST="111.111.111.111"
XDEBUG_IDEKEY="PHPSTORM"
```

.zshrc version, supporting dynamic IPÂ´s:
```
export XDEBUG_REMOTE_HOST=$(ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep broadcast | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
export XDEBUG_IDEKEY="PHPSTORM"
```
